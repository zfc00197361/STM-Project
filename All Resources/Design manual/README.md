Design Manual
Model the Application.
Design and Describe how the application will be used:
e.g. use cases in UML;
e.g. Navigation sequence in Web based project;
This may necessitate some high level design in order to convey how the application may be used to access its functionality;
User interfaces should be specified loosely here (possibly screen shots of prototype user interfaces - you will not be held to using these UIs they are just to assist in explanation of your project functionality);
Major architectural components and their relationship to each other should also be diagramatically (with brief explanation paragraphs) presented here e.g Database backend, web server front end with ODBC connecting them etc.;
Include any element that you would feel conveys how you perceive your project will function.
