C++ Software Transactional Memory (S\+TM)

This documentation includes all the project specific files that required to build the S\+TM library and the client code to use the library. The client code is demostrate the usage of the S\+TM A\+PI (Application Programming Interface). The S\+TM library is a object based implementation, where the client need to inherite from the library on order to achieve the polymorphic Object Oriented Programming (O\+OP) behaviour.

The client application use a middle class to declare the child (Classes inherite from \hyperlink{class_b_a_n_k}{B\+A\+NK}) specific behaviour as a virtual methods. Whit this implementation the client application need to casting back the O\+S\+TM object to \hyperlink{class_b_a_n_k}{B\+A\+NK} object to use the child class implemented speciffic behaviours.
