00001 C++ Software Transactional Memory (STM)
00002 
00003 This documentation includes all the project specific files that required to build the STM library and
       the
00004 client code to use the library. The client code is demostrate the usage of the STM API (Application
       Programming Interface).
00005 The STM library is a object based implementation, where the client need to inherite from the library
       on order to
00006 achieve the polymorphic Object Oriented Programming (OOP) behaviour. 
00007 
00008 The client application use a middle class to declare the child (Classes inherite from BANK) specific
       behaviour as a virtual methods. 
00009 Whit this implementation the client application need to casting back the OSTM object to BANK object to
       use the child class
00010 implemented speciffic behaviours.
